This is my small blog. Nothing fancy,just a few short logs about my adventures.
Later on i would like to expand this site ,but for now this will do.
I am a 10+ years veteran gnu/linux experienced enduser,with some oversight on other topics. Really interested in repurposing old hardware if its usefull and effective.
